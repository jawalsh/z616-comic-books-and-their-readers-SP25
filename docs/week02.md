## In class
- review class comic archive and [online collections](comics-studies-resources.html#digital-comics-collections)
- Interview another student about their fandom, and report back to the class. Start with 
“What type of fandom do you want to tell me about (comics, film, manga, music, pokemon, etc.)?” and adapt the questions below as necessary.
