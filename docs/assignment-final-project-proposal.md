# Final Project Proposal

Submit an proposal, of approximately 300-500 words, in which outline your plans for your final project. Your proposal should include:

1. **tentative title**;
2. **summary content, corpus, or data set** A summary of the content and/or data set(s) that you will be examining (e.g., fan mail published in _The Fantastic Four_, January 1973 - December 1978);
3. **research questions** The research questions you plan to explore through your analysis;
4. **methodology** The methods you will apply to analyze your content and/or data set(s) (e.g., close reading and content analysis, computational text analysis, topic modeling, ethnography, etc.);
5. **deliverables** A description of the product that you will turn in for the final project. Since you have a lot of flexibility in choosing both the topic and the format of your final project, you need to describe the form or genre of your final project (e.g., research paper, blog post, [data paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_publishing#Data_papers), critical [digital collection](https://collectionbuilder.github.io)). 

Submit your proposal as a PDF or Word document in Canvas.
