## Discussion: Paratext show and tell

Browse through the comics in our "z672 Comics" folder on OneDrive or any other comics or related documents, and find an interesting paratext. In the discussion, describe your paratext. Your example may be a peritext (in the comic book) or an epitext (located outside the comic book).

In one or more paragraphs:
- Explain what the paratext is, its function, and its location. 
- Discuss how the paratext relates (or does not relate) to the comics content. 
- Include an image or screen capture of the paratext.
- Respond with substantive comments or questions to at least one peers.
- Submit your work in the Canvas [discussion](https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2204459/discussion_topics/13437195)
