# Final Project

The final project is a hybrid research paper/[data paper](https://openhumanitiesdata.metajnl.com) and a [short video presentation](assignment-video.md). 

You will write a research paper, with a data paper component, that explores some aspect or manifestation of comic book fandom or readership. 

Your exploration should include an analysis of relevant data that you generate or that you acquire from existing sources, and those data should be well documented and made available (for instance on [GitHub](https://github.com) or OneDrive).

Your audience consists of academics and library professionals, but they likely do not have expertise in comic books or participatory comic book culture and you should provide necessary context for readers who are not comics experts. 

Please reach out to us if you are interested in presenting your work in some alternative format or media other than the traditional research paper.

Submit your assignment materials as a PDF or Word document in Canvas.

Data set and data collection methods are clearly described in paper. If applicable: The data files are clearly named and organized and include a README file that explains the contents of the data set; links to data files and README are included in the final paper. | 4&#x00a0;&#x00a0;&#x00a0;&#x00a0;3&#x00a0;&#x00a0;&#x00a0;&#x00a0;2&#x00a0;&#x00a0;&#x00a0;&#x00a0;1   |
