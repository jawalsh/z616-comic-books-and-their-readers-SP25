# Fanzine

For this assignment, alone or with a partner, you will produce a single issue of a fanzine. A [fanzine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanzine) (or zine) is “a non-professional and non-official publication produced by enthusiasts of a particular cultural phenomenon (such as a literary or musical genre) for the pleasure of others who share their interest” (Wikipedia. “[Fanzine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanzine)”).

- The fanzine can be on any subject, but you are encouraged to choose a topic related to comics, pop culture, and fandom.
- The zine must have an identifiable cover, title, table of contents, and introduction.
- Apart from the introductory material (cover, title, contents, introduction), your zine must have 3 or more additional content items. A content item could be whatever fits the subject and purpose of your zine. Examples of possible content items are articles, biographies, reference lists, art galleries, puzzles, games, news, letters from readers, fiction, poetry, comics.
- Including cover, introduction, table of contents, and three or more content items, your fanzine should have at least twelve pages.
- If you work with a partner, also submit, on a separate piece of paper, a paragraph that explains each student’s contribution.
